# Week 2 - Learning by doing together!

Hey

Last week we talked about community. We could probably have a complete course on that and call it “Community in a Box”. Someone may be doing just [that](http://community.p2pu.org/t/please-introduce-yourself/28/114)!

If you missed last week, don’t worry, you can join the conversation on [discourse](http://community.p2pu.org/t/course-in-a-box-community-safari/1153) and continue working on the projects at your own pace.

This week we are discussing learning design. We have several projects to help us learn:

- [Look how other courses do it](http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/learning/projects/).
- [Plan your learning outcomes](http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/learning/projects/).
- [Add modules to your course in GitHub](http://howto.p2pu.org/modules/learning/projects/).

Since this week is not a fully fledged week for everyone around the world, we are considering rescheduling the hangout. Please indicate your preference on the [doodle poll](http://doodle.com/acgcyxqzhb8staeq).

Cheers
The P2PU Team
